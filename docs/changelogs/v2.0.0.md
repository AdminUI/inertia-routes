# Version 2.0.0

## Migrating to version 2

Settings from `/config/inertia.php` will no longer be read since they have been moved to a dedicated package configuration file. You can publish the new configuration file like so:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=inertia-routes
```

Full instructions regarding how to configure Inertia Routes can be found in the published config file

## New Features

- Multiple configurations can now be set up for Inertia Routes
- Change configuration by calling `AdminUI\InertiaRoutes\Facades\InertiaRoutes::setConfig('my-settings')` from within your Laravel app
- `Filter` callable/function can be passed from your config to allow a final chance to add/remove routes. Useful for applying user permissions to provided routes

## Other changes

- Moved share functionality to middleware rather than using the package boot method
